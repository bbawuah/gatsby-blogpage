Philosopher Michel Foucault gave us an apple to shape our own existence in a certain direction. 

But to what extent can we "shape our lives" in our society?

<h3>We live in a panopticon society</h3>
<p>
According to Foucault, our time is all about far-reaching control over people. He compares this model with the panopticon. And nothing could be further from the truth today.
</br>
</p>
<h3>The power of fear</h3>
<p>
The corona virus has turned the world upside down. That world we know will no longer be the same. To stop the pandemic, entire populations must adhere to certain restrictions.
</br>
</br>
Many governments choose to monitor their society and punish those who break their restrictions. Technology has made it possible for the first time in history to control such entire populations. 
</br>
</br>
The coronavirus and the associated restrictions have opened my eyes and also made me think to what extent we have the freedom to give our own twist to our lives?
</br>
</p>
<h3>A demarcated playground</h3>
<p>
I compare our lives with children playing at a playground. The children have a slide that they can play with, a sandbox, a football which they can play many games with. But the playground is also demarcated with fences. The children are not allowed to play outside these gates.
</br>
</br>
Are these children really free beings? Or are they just trying to make the best of their lives despite the restriction?
</br>
</br>
You could say that the fences of the playground are placed out of safety measures. 
</br>
</br>
However, I believe that these fences have been placed to give direction and shape to the child. 
</br>
</br>
In addition, an environment that these children havenâ€™t been or have no knowledge of, They cannot label as a dangerous area.
</br>
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I believe that power groups have placed restrictions on our lives to shape our mindset and direct our lives in a certain direction. This has both positive and negative sides.
</br>
</br>
But this is the reality.
</br>
</br>
We must ask ourselves to what extent we are free creatures?..
