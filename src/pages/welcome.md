<h3>True happiness</h3>
<p>
I have always been a driven person. As a little boy, I always had dreams to become successful and to take care of my parents financially. Throughout my life I‚Äôve come to realize that becoming successful is actually not a destination. <em>It is the journey that matters the most</em>. 
</br>
</br>
Through this revelation, life in itself got a totally different meaning for me.

I‚Äôll go deeper in this topic in the following articles.

I spend a lot of my time investing in myself by learning new skills. Two of my hobbies is creating digital illustrations and discovering street art. I especially love the way postmodern reaction to modernism. I love to see how people use their art to share their view on the world, with the world.

Meanwhile the world‚Äôs 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 percent of the planet‚Äôs population. This is the result of capitalism.

Our economic system highlights human greed.
