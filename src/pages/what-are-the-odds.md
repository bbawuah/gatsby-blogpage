A lot of sectors and government agencies use algorithms to calculate a future scenario.

But to what extent do we let algorithms run their course?

<h3>It rains data</h3>
<p>
To predict the future, an algorithm needs a list of past events (data). Without data, an algorithm is useless.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately (or not..),  we live in a time where it rains data. About 500 million tweets are posted on Twitter every day and about 65 billion messages are sent via Whatsapp. This data is used by companies to get to know us better and to offer us the content <strong>they think</strong> we want to see. They make predictions based on the past.
</p>
<p>
Companies give us personalized ads because of this and I have to admit, that I like that. I no longer have to search for a new laptop for hours, but I get the best deal in my timeline on social media.
</p>

<h3>The darker side of algorithms</h3>
<p>
What I'm more afraid of is that algorithms influence our way of thinking and perception of reality.
</p>

<p>
Algorithms are currently used by government agencies to predict future criminals. The <strong>COMPAS</strong> algorithm is an example of this. Although I understand the intention of the usage of this algorithm, <strong>I am strongly against this.</strong>

<h3>The flip of a coin</h3>
<p>
Algorithms predict the future but cannot <strong>determine</strong> the future. There is nothing on earth that can guarantee the future with 100%. At the end of the day, an algorithm is just a gamble.
</p>

<p>
It‚Äôs very bad when we start gambling if people will commit criminal activities again in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Nothing and nobody has the right to gamble with the freedom of another.
</p>

<p>
Reintegration of detainees should be determined by showing good behavior. Algorithms only look at statistics, and sometimes our statistics say nothing about our future.
</p>

<p>
The bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 5:17 that if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. <em>The old things has passed away.</em> 
</p>

<blockquote><em>I believe that anyone can turn their lives around at any time through Jesus Christ.</em></blockquote>

<h3>Algorithms are bias, because we are</h3>
<p>
Pro Publica is a non-profit organization that investigates criminal risk scores. According to investigative journalist Julia Angwin, Pro Publica has reviewed the scores of 18,000 people over two years in a Florida jurisdiction. They checked whether the predictions were actually correct.
</p>

<p>
The COMPAS algorithm had an accuracy of 60%, which is a little bit more than the flip of a coin..ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
</p>

<p>
But what really stood out was that when the prediction was wrong, it was predicted twice as often that a dark man would relapse when this was not the case and twice as often predicted that a white man would not relapse when it was.
</p>

<p>
These algorithms are built by a group of people who have their own view of the world. Their bias is built-in the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Algorithms can make our lives easier by predicting the future in other areas.
</p>

<p>
But when it comes to decision-making about human freedom, we can't bet.
