Our economy is constantly changing. Millennials are increasingly looking for flexible work and startups such as Temper, Uber and Deliveroo are responding well to this. 


These startups promise a future where everyone is an entrepreneur. But is this really true? Or do they only sell a dream?


<h3>The headstrong millenial</h3>
<blockquote>
<em>“Millennials increasingly feel the need to decide where, for what and for whom they want to work. This is what we as a company respond well to. ” </em> - Paul Eggink, CEO Temper.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hourly rates on these platforms are often higher than a standard hourly rate in paid employment. But unfortunately many people don't look at the fine print.
</p>

<h3>The entrepeneur without a voice</h3>
<p>
To get started in the click and job economy, you must register with the Chamber of Commerce as an independent entrepreneur. From this moment on, you will work as a company / freelancer for your employer.
</p>

<p>
On top of that comes the fact that as a company, you have now lost your social security, The right to contract hours and a reasonable health care reward. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>"Platforms like these want to take away these rights from people ” </em> - Aral Balkan, Cyborg rights activist and developer.
</blockquote>

<p>
a Deliveroo bicycle courier reported that he cycled for two hours at a time without getting an order. Since there were no orders, he worked for zero euros these two hours, which is far below the minimum wage..
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>"Since there were no orders, he worked for <strong>0 euros</strong> these two hours."</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>An inhuman position</h3>
<p>
These companies could potentially turn individuals into micro entrepreneurs. However, the problem is under what conditions they want to achieve this. These platforms all have competitors and can easily create a certain lock-in, making it more difficult for the freelancer to switch to a competitor.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the freelancer is more dependent on the employer than the other way around. The freelancer has nothing to say. He can't negotiate about his rates, when and how he wants to work. These online platforms get to decide everything. The power relationship between the two companies is unfair. 
</p>

<p>
The click and job economy has a lot of potential and offers and responds well to the desires of the millennial.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that these companies put their employees away as freelancers and put them in an inhuman position.
</p>

<strong>This needs to change.</strong>
